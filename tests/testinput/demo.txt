TerminalTextEffects applies visual effects to text in the terminal.

The TTE animation engine has the following features:
        * Xterm 256 / RGB hex color support
        * Complex character movement via Paths, Waypoints, and
          motion easing.
        * Complex animations via Scenes with symbol/color changes,
          layers, easing, and Path synced progression.
        * Event handling for Path/Scene state changes with 
          custom callback support and many pre-defined actions.
        * Variable stop/step color gradient generation. 
        * Extensive effect customization via per-effect arguments.
        * Runs inline, preserving terminal state and workflow.
